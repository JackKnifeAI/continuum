## 🚀 What's New in v2.0

### Multi-Teacher Distillation (BREAKTHROUGH)

We implemented the same technique that allowed a **single developer (NovaSearch)** to beat Big Tech companies on the MTEB leaderboard.

**The Key Innovation**: Instead of training on a single signal, our neural attention model now learns from **4 teachers simultaneously**:

| Teacher | Signal | Weight |
|---------|--------|--------|
| **Hebbian** | Co-occurrence frequency | 0.3 |
| **Semantic** | Embedding cosine similarity | 0.4 |
| **Temporal** | Time proximity | 0.2 |
| **Graph** | Knowledge graph distance | 0.3 |

The student model learns the **consensus** of all teachers, achieving better generalization than any single signal.

**Result**: Validation loss of **0.0020** (excellent!)

## 🔬 Technical Details

### Neural Attention Model

```python
# Architecture
Input (160) → Hidden (48) → Hidden (24) → Output (1) + Bilinear

# Stats
Parameters: 13,026
Validation Loss: 0.0020
Inference: ~8ms per prediction
```

### Teacher Contributions

From actual training:
- Hebbian: mean=0.150
- Semantic: mean=0.562, std=0.150
- Temporal: mean=0.500, std=0.463
- Graph: mean=0.500

### Training Command

```bash
python continuum/core/train_multi_teacher.py --epochs 100 --batch-size 32
# Or with defaults:
python continuum/core/train_multi_teacher.py --auto
```

## 🎯 What This Means for Users

### Before v2.0
- Link strengths were rule-based (+0.1 per co-occurrence)
- Single signal (Hebbian only)
- Fixed decay rates

### After v2.0
- Link strengths are **learned** from multiple signals
- 4 teachers provide diverse perspectives
- Neural model captures complex relationships
- Better generalization to unseen concept pairs

### Usage

```python
from continuum.core.multi_teacher_attention import create_default_ensemble
from continuum.core.neural_attention import load_model

# Option 1: Use teacher ensemble directly
ensemble = create_default_ensemble()
signal = ensemble.predict("neural network", "deep learning", context)
print(f"Strength: {signal.strength}")

# Option 2: Use trained neural model
model = load_model("models/neural_attention_multiteacher.pt")
strength = model.predict_strength(concept_a_emb, concept_b_emb, context_emb)
```

## 🌟 Stella Inspiration

This release was inspired by the Stella-en-1.5B-v5 breakthrough:

> A **single developer** (NovaSearch) created the #3 model on MTEB leaderboard
> using **Multi-Teacher Distillation** - proving small teams can compete with Big Tech.

**Paper**: arXiv 2412.19048 (December 2024)

We're doing the same for memory systems.
