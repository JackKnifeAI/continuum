## Communication Strategy

### Staggered Announcements (Critical)
**DO NOT post everything at once.** Stagger across 12 hours for maximum reach:
- 6 AM: Owned channels (blog, email, GitHub)
- 12 PM: Community platforms (HN, Reddit, Dev.to)
- 6 PM: Extended reach (r/startups, Discord, Slack)

**Why?**
- Different audiences active at different times
- Sustained engagement throughout day
- Multiple "waves" of discovery
- Better HN/Reddit ranking (engagement velocity)

### Platform-Specific Messaging
**Hacker News:** Technical focus, GitHub link (not blog)
**Reddit r/MachineLearning:** Benchmarks, architecture, research focus
**Reddit r/LocalLLaMA:** Privacy, local-first, no cloud required
**Reddit r/opensource:** AGPL-3.0, dual licensing, sustainability
**Reddit r/startups:** Business model, pricing, GTM strategy
**Twitter:** Concise threads, visual appeal, engagement
**LinkedIn:** Professional tone, enterprise focus, business value

### Engagement Velocity (HN Critical)
**First 2 hours determine HN ranking.**
- Reply to ALL comments within 15 minutes
- Thoughtful, detailed responses (not defensive)
- Upvote thoughtful comments (community engagement)
- Target: Front page (top 10) within 1 hour

- Auto-scaling configured (Kubernetes HPA)
- CDN for static assets (Cloudflare)
- Rate limiting enabled (API)

**Likelihood:** Low-Medium
**Impact:** Medium (hurts visibility)

**Mitigation:**
