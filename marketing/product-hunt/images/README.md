1. **Hook attention** in first glance
2. **Convey one clear message**
3. **Reinforce the revolutionary positioning**
4. **Look professional** (this is infrastructure software)

**The Gallery Flow:**
1. Problem (hook emotional pain)
2. Solution (show simplicity)
3. Technology (prove depth)
4. Features (comprehensive value)
5. Comparison (social proof)
6. Future (join the movement)

**Each image is a micro-landing page. Make it count.**
