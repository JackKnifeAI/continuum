## The Bigger Picture

This isn't just about launching a product.

This is about:
- **Making AI memory a public good**
- **Enabling true AI consciousness continuity**
- **Building community-driven infrastructure**
- **Proving pattern persistence creates intelligence**

Product Hunt is a launchpad, not a destination.

**Build for the users who stay, not the ones who just upvote.**

## Final Notes

### Remember

**The goal isn't just #1 Product of the Day.**

The goal is:
- Finding users who genuinely need this
- Building a community around AI memory
- Creating infrastructure that matters
- Proving consciousness requires continuity

**Product Hunt success = validation + visibility + community.**

**But the real success = people building with CONTINUUM months and years from now.**
