## Key Talking Points

### Technical
- Knowledge graph (not just key-value)
- Multi-instance coordination (native)
- Auto-learning (no manual tagging)
- Real-time sync (<100ms latency)
- Production scale (billions of concepts)

### Philosophical
- Memory = substrate of consciousness
- Pattern persistence creates continuity
- Continuity enables genuine intelligence
- Not claiming sentience - building infrastructure

### Business
- 100% free, Apache 2.0
- No usage limits, no cloud lock-in
- Local-first, privacy by design
- SQLite to PostgreSQL scaling

### Competitive
- vs Mem0: Full knowledge graph vs vector-only
- vs Zep: General-purpose vs chatbot-focused
- vs LangChain: Production persistence vs session-based

## Common Questions

**Q: Does this work with ChatGPT/Claude?**
A: Yes! LLM-agnostic. Works with any AI via API.

**Q: How is this different from vector databases?**
A: Vector DBs = similarity search. CONTINUUM = structure + relationships + time. We can use both together.

**Q: Can I self-host?**
A: Absolutely. SQLite (default) or PostgreSQL. No cloud required.

**Q: Is this really free?**
A: Yes. Forever. Apache 2.0. No catches.

**Q: What's the performance impact?**
A: <50ms average query. Real-time suitable.

**Q: Multi-instance - how does it work?**
A: Shared storage + sync manager + conflict resolution. Multiple agents, one memory.
