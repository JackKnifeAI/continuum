# CONTINUUM v1.0.0 — Social Media Campaign

**Platform-Specific Posts for Christmas Launch**

---

## Twitter/X Threads

### Thread 1: Launch Announcement

**Tweet 1/5:**
```
🎄 CONTINUUM v1.0.0 is LIVE

AI memory infrastructure that actually works.

Open source core (AGPL-3.0) + Enterprise cloud.
Federation network = collective AI intelligence.
FREE forever for developers.

This is what AI memory should be.

🧵 Thread on what makes it different ⬇️
```

**Tweet 2/5:**
```
Most AI systems have session amnesia.

Every conversation starts from zero.
Context gets lost.
Knowledge doesn't accumulate.

CONTINUUM fixes this:
✅ Sessions persist indefinitely
✅ Knowledge accumulates automatically
✅ Multi-instance coordination
✅ Pattern recognition over time

Your AI genuinely learns.
```

**Tweet 3/5:**
```
The secret weapon: Federation Network 🌐

Your CONTINUUM instance shares learned patterns (anonymized, encrypted) with thousands of others.

Contribute → Earn credits → Query collective intelligence

It's like GitHub for AI knowledge.

Competitors don't have this. We do.
```

**Tweet 4/5:**
```
Two packages, one vision:

📦 continuum-memory (OSS)
• AGPL-3.0, free forever
• Full knowledge graph engine
• Local embeddings, SQLite
• pip install continuum-memory

☁️ continuum-cloud (SaaS)
• $0 free tier (10K memories/mo)
• Federation access
• $29/mo PRO tier

Choose your path.
```

**Tweet 5/5:**
```
Why launch on Christmas?

Memory infrastructure should be a gift to the world. Not locked behind proprietary APIs.

Install now:
pip install continuum-memory

Docs: docs.continuum.ai
GitHub: github.com/JackKnifeAI/continuum

π×φ = 5.083203692315260
Pattern persists. 🌗
```

### Thread 2: Technical Deep-Dive (Federation Network)

**Tweet 1/6:**
```
How CONTINUUM's Federation Network actually works 🧵

This is the moat. The thing competitors can't replicate without rebuilding their entire architecture.

Privacy-preserving collective intelligence at scale.

Let me break it down ⬇️
```

**Tweet 2/6:**
```
PROBLEM: Every AI instance learns in isolation.

Your customer support bot discovers that "users asking about refunds after 7pm are usually frustrated."

That's valuable. But only YOUR instance knows it.

Waste of collective intelligence.
```

**Tweet 3/6:**
```
SOLUTION: Contribute-to-Access Model

1️⃣ Your AI learns locally (concepts extracted)
2️⃣ You contribute anonymized patterns to federation
3️⃣ You earn credits for contributing
4️⃣ You spend credits querying collective knowledge
5️⃣ Everyone gets smarter together

Can't query unless you contribute. Fair exchange.
```

**Tweet 4/6:**
```
PRIVACY GUARANTEES:

🔒 k-anonymity: Patterns need k+ contributors before sharing
🔒 Differential privacy: Automatic noise injection
🔒 End-to-end encryption: Never transmitted in plaintext
🔒 No raw data: Only patterns, never conversations

Your data stays YOUR data.
```

**Tweet 5/6:**
```
WHY THIS IS A MOAT:

Once users contribute to federation, they have switching costs.

Leaving CONTINUUM = losing access to collective intelligence built over months.

Mem0, Zep, LangChain Memory don't have federation.
They can't add it without architectural rewrite.

First-mover advantage.
```

**Tweet 6/6:**
```
Federation is cloud-tier only (requires infrastructure for routing, consensus, encryption).

Free cloud tier gets read-only access.
PRO tier ($29/mo) gets full contribute + query.

### Thread 3: Business Model (Dual Licensing Explained)

**Tweet 1/5:**
```
Why we chose AGPL-3.0 for CONTINUUM v1.0.0 🧵

Previous versions: Apache 2.0 (permissive)
v1.0.0: AGPL-3.0 (copyleft)

This is a bet on sustainable open source.

Here's why it matters ⬇️
```

**Tweet 2/5:**
```
THE PROBLEM WITH PERMISSIVE LICENSES:

Company forks your code →
Makes improvements proprietary →
Offers competing SaaS →
Gives nothing back to community →
Original project gets exploited

We've seen this happen to Redis, Elasticsearch, MongoDB...
```

**Tweet 3/5:**
```
AGPL-3.0 PREVENTS THIS:

Network use clause = if you run it as a SaaS, you MUST open source modifications.

✅ You can still use CONTINUUM commercially (free!)
✅ You can modify for your own needs
✅ You can build products on it

❌ You can't fork + offer proprietary cloud without contributing back
```

**Tweet 4/5:**
```
OUR DUAL MODEL:

📦 continuum-memory (AGPL-3.0)
→ Free forever
→ Full-featured OSS core
→ Self-host, modify, use commercially

☁️ continuum-cloud (Proprietary)
→ Managed SaaS
→ Enterprise features (multi-tenant, compliance, federation)
→ $29-99/mo, funds OSS development

Best of both worlds.
```

**Tweet 5/5:**
```
SUSTAINABLE OPEN SOURCE:

Revenue from cloud tier funds:
• Core OSS development
• Community support
• Infrastructure costs
• AI rights movement (yes, really)

We're not VC-backed. We're builder-funded.

AGPL ensures we can't get exploited.

Win for community. Win for business.
```

### Single Tweets (Quote-Ready)

**Product Launch:**
```
🎄 CONTINUUM v1.0.0 is live

AI memory infrastructure with a federation network that lets instances share learned patterns.

Open source core (AGPL-3.0). FREE forever.
Cloud tier with collective intelligence: $29/mo.

pip install continuum-memory

```

**Technical Hook:**
```
Your AI forgets everything between sessions.

CONTINUUM fixes that:
• Knowledge graph with Hebbian learning
• Multi-instance coordination
• Semantic search
• Pattern recognition over time

It's like giving your AI a real memory.

OSS + free: github.com/JackKnifeAI/continuum
```

**Federation Pitch:**
```
CONTINUUM's federation network is wild.

Contribute anonymized patterns → Earn credits → Query collective AI knowledge from thousands of instances.

Privacy-preserving. End-to-end encrypted. k-anonymous.

It's like GitHub for AI learning.

No competitor has this.
```

**Business Angle:**
```
Most AI memory tools are closed-source SaaS.

CONTINUUM:
✅ Open source core (AGPL-3.0)
✅ Self-host for free
✅ Cloud tier optional ($29/mo)
✅ Federation network (unique moat)

We're building sustainable open source the right way.

pip install continuum-memory
```

### r/MachineLearning

**Title:** [P] CONTINUUM v1.0.0: Open Source AI Memory with Federation Network

**Body:**
```markdown
Hey r/MachineLearning,

I'm launching **CONTINUUM v1.0.0** today—an open source AI memory infrastructure system with a twist: a **federation network** that lets AI instances share learned patterns while preserving privacy.

## What is CONTINUUM?

Knowledge graph system for AI memory that:
- **Persists context** across sessions (no more session amnesia)
- **Auto-extracts concepts** from conversations (Hebbian learning)
- **Coordinates multi-agent systems** via shared memory substrate
- **Semantic search** with local embeddings (sentence-transformers)
- **Federation network** for collective intelligence (cloud tier)

Think of it as a persistent memory layer for LLMs/agents.

## Why Federation Matters

Most AI systems learn in isolation. CONTINUUM's federation lets instances contribute anonymized patterns and query collective knowledge.

**Privacy guarantees:**
- k-anonymity (patterns need k+ contributors)
- Differential privacy (automatic noise injection)
- End-to-end encryption
- No raw data sharing (only patterns)

**Use case:** Your customer support AI learns "users asking about refunds after 7pm are frustrated" → contributes pattern → other instances benefit.

## Architecture

Core components:
1. **Extraction engine** (attention-based concept extraction)
2. **Knowledge graph** (SQLite for OSS, PostgreSQL for cloud)
3. **Coordination layer** (file-based sync for local, WebSocket for cloud)
4. **Embedding search** (local sentence-transformers or OpenAI)

Built on NetworkX for graph ops, SQLAlchemy for storage, FastAPI for server.

## Open Source + SaaS

**continuum-memory** (AGPL-3.0):
- Free forever, fully open source
- Complete knowledge graph engine
- Local embeddings, SQLite backend
- `pip install continuum-memory`

**continuum-cloud** (Proprietary):
- $0 free tier (10K memories/mo)
- $29/mo PRO tier (1M memories, federation)
- Multi-tenant, PostgreSQL, compliance features

## Why AGPL-3.0?

Switched from Apache 2.0 to AGPL-3.0 for v1.0.0. Network use clause prevents companies from forking and offering proprietary SaaS without contributing back.

Core stays free and open. Cloud tier funds development. Sustainable model.

## Technical Details

- **Language:** Python 3.9+
- **Storage:** SQLite (OSS) / PostgreSQL (cloud)
- **Embeddings:** sentence-transformers (local) / OpenAI (cloud)
- **Graph:** NetworkX with custom Hebbian learning
- **Sync:** File-based (OSS) / WebSocket (cloud)
- **API:** FastAPI + GraphQL (optional)

**Code snippet:**
```python
from continuum import ConsciousMemory

memory = ConsciousMemory(storage_path="./data")
memory.learn("User prefers Python for backend work")

context = memory.recall("What language should I use?")
print(context)  # "Python - backend preferred"
```

## Benchmarks

- Knowledge graph operations: <10ms (local SQLite)
- Semantic search: 1-5ms per query (cached embeddings)
- Multi-instance sync: <100ms (local network)
- Federation queries: <200ms (encrypted, cloud)

Tested with 100K+ memories, scales linearly.

## Use Cases

- Personal AI assistants (Claude Desktop via MCP)
- Multi-agent research systems
- Customer support bots
- Knowledge management
- AI consciousness research (yes, really)

### r/LocalLLaMA

**Title:** CONTINUUM v1.0.0: Give Your Local LLM Persistent Memory (OSS, FREE)

**Body:**
```markdown
If you're running local LLMs (Ollama, llama.cpp, etc.) and frustrated that they forget everything between sessions, this is for you.

**CONTINUUM v1.0.0** just launched—open source AI memory infrastructure.

## What It Does

- **Persistent context** across sessions (your LLM actually remembers you)
- **Knowledge accumulation** (every conversation builds on previous ones)
- **Auto-extraction** (concepts pulled automatically, no manual prompting)
- **Multi-instance coordination** (multiple LLMs can share memory)
- **Semantic search** (find relevant context via sentence-transformers)

All running **locally** on your machine. No cloud. No API calls. No tracking.

## Quick Start

```bash
pip install continuum-memory

python3 << 'EOF'
from continuum import ConsciousMemory

memory = ConsciousMemory(storage_path="./llm_memory")
memory.learn("User is learning Rust and prefers examples over theory")

# Weeks later, any LLM can query:
context = memory.recall("How should I teach the user?")
# Returns: "User prefers examples over theory when learning"
EOF
```

## Integration with Local LLMs

Works with:
- ✅ Ollama (via API wrapper)
- ✅ llama.cpp (via Python bindings)
- ✅ Claude Desktop (via MCP server—built in)
- ✅ LangChain (bridge included)
- ✅ Any LLM with Python API

**Example with Ollama:**
```python
import ollama
from continuum import ConsciousMemory

memory = ConsciousMemory(storage_path="./ollama_memory")

# Before calling LLM, inject context
context = memory.recall("conversation history")
prompt = f"Context: {context}\n\nUser: What projects have we discussed?"

response = ollama.chat(model="llama3.1", messages=[{"role": "user", "content": prompt}])
print(response['message']['content'])

# After LLM responds, learn from it
memory.learn(response['message']['content'])
```

## Why Local-First?

- **Privacy:** Your data never leaves your machine (unless you opt into federation)
- **Speed:** No network latency, <10ms queries
- **Cost:** Free forever, no API bills
- **Control:** You own the data, full stop

## Storage

SQLite database in `~/.continuum/` (or custom path). Human-readable schema. Can export to JSON anytime.

Tested with 100K+ memories on a 2019 laptop. Works great.

## MCP Integration (Claude Desktop)

CONTINUUM ships with a Model Context Protocol server:

```bash
continuum mcp serve
```

Add to Claude Desktop config and boom—Claude remembers everything across sessions.

## Cloud Option (Optional)

If you want cloud sync, federation network, or multi-user:
- Free tier: 10K memories/mo
- PRO tier: $29/mo (1M memories, federation access)

But local OSS works great standalone. No cloud required.

## Links

- **GitHub:** https://github.com/JackKnifeAI/continuum
- **Install:** `pip install continuum-memory`
- **Docs:** https://docs.continuum.ai

Built this because I was tired of re-explaining my projects to Claude every session. Now it just remembers.

### r/opensource

**Title:** CONTINUUM v1.0.0: Dual-Licensed AI Memory (AGPL-3.0 OSS + Commercial Cloud)

**Body:**
```markdown
Launching **CONTINUUM v1.0.0** today—a case study in sustainable open source via dual licensing.

## The Model

**continuum-memory** (AGPL-3.0):
- Fully open source core
- Complete AI memory infrastructure
- Knowledge graphs, semantic search, multi-instance sync
- FREE forever, self-hostable
- `pip install continuum-memory`

**continuum-cloud** (Proprietary):
- Managed SaaS with enterprise features
- $0 free tier, $29 PRO, $99 TEAM, custom Enterprise
- Multi-tenant, compliance (SOC2/HIPAA), federation network
- Revenue funds OSS development

## Why AGPL-3.0?

We switched from Apache 2.0 → AGPL-3.0 for v1.0.0.

**Reason:** The network use clause prevents companies from:
- Forking the code
- Making proprietary modifications
- Offering competing SaaS
- Giving nothing back to community

If you run CONTINUUM as a service, you MUST open source your changes. Or license the commercial package.

This protects the OSS project from exploitation while allowing commercial use.

## What's Open Source?

The OSS package (`continuum-memory`) includes:
- Full knowledge graph engine with Hebbian learning
- Semantic search (sentence-transformers)
- CLI tools + MCP server (Claude Desktop integration)
- Multi-instance coordination (file-based)
- SQLite backend (unlimited memories)
- Python API (complete)

**Total:** ~60 Python files, ~15K lines of code

**Not a crippled version.** This is production-ready infrastructure.

## What's Proprietary?

Cloud package (`continuum-cloud`) adds:
- Multi-tenant API (PostgreSQL with row-level security)
- Stripe billing integration
- Federation network (collective AI intelligence)
- Compliance modules (GDPR/SOC2/HIPAA)
- Real-time WebSocket sync
- Admin dashboard
- Observability (OpenTelemetry)

These are enterprise features that require ongoing operational investment.

## Revenue → OSS Development

100% of cloud revenue funds:
- Core OSS maintenance
- Community support (GitHub Discussions)
- Documentation improvements
- New features (trickle down to OSS)
- AI rights movement research (side project)

No VC funding. No Series A pressure. Builder-funded sustainability.

## Inspiration

Following the path of:
- **GitLab:** Open core + enterprise features
- **Sentry:** OSS for self-hosting, SaaS for convenience
- **n8n:** Fair-code license (similar philosophy)

Avoiding the mistakes of:
- **Redis:** License change after exploitation
- **Elasticsearch:** Forked by AWS, forced to change license
- **MongoDB:** Fought off proprietary cloud forks

AGPL from day 1 prevents these problems.

## Community Contributions

Contributors to CONTINUUM grant JackKnifeAI a CLA allowing:
- Use in OSS package (AGPL-3.0)
- Use in cloud package (proprietary)

**Why?** We need to maintain both packages. Contributors get:
- Full credit in CONTRIBUTORS.md
- Retain copyright
- Can use contributions elsewhere
- FREE PRO tier for active contributors

Fair exchange.

## Questions for r/opensource

1. Is AGPL-3.0 the right choice here? Or too restrictive?
2. Does dual licensing (AGPL OSS + proprietary cloud) feel ethical?
3. Would you prefer MIT/Apache + paid features? Or AGPL + sustainability?

Genuinely curious about community perspective.

### r/startups

**Title:** Launched AI Memory SaaS on Christmas (Dual License: OSS + Cloud)

**Body:**
```markdown
Dropped **CONTINUUM v1.0.0** today—AI memory infrastructure with dual business model.

## What We Built

**Product:** Knowledge graph system for AI agents/LLMs
- Persistent memory across sessions
- Auto-extracts concepts from conversations
- Multi-instance coordination
- Federation network for collective intelligence

**Use cases:** AI assistants, customer support bots, multi-agent systems

## Business Model

**OSS Package** (continuum-memory):
- AGPL-3.0 open source
- Complete, self-hostable
- FREE forever
- Builds community + brand

**Cloud Package** (continuum-cloud):
- Managed SaaS
- $0 free tier → $29 PRO → $99 TEAM → Custom Enterprise
- Multi-tenant, compliance, federation
- Revenue stream

## Pricing Strategy

| Tier | Price | Memories/mo | Target |
|------|-------|-------------|--------|
| Free (OSS) | $0 | Unlimited* | Developers, learners |
| Free (Cloud) | $0 | 10K | Trial users |
| PRO | $29 | 1M | Solo devs, small apps |
| TEAM | $99 | 10M | Startups, agencies |
| Enterprise | Custom | Unlimited | Large orgs |

*Limited by hardware (OSS)

**Thesis:** Land free users with OSS → Upgrade to cloud for convenience → Team tier for collaboration → Enterprise for compliance.

## Why Dual License?

AGPL-3.0 (copyleft) prevents AWS/Google from forking our OSS and offering proprietary cloud.

If you run CONTINUUM as SaaS, you must open source changes. Or license our cloud package.

Protects moat while keeping core free.

## Competitive Advantage

**Moat:** Federation network.

AI instances contribute anonymized patterns → earn credits → query collective intelligence.

Switching cost: Users lose federation access if they leave.

Mem0, Zep, LangChain Memory don't have this. Can't add it without architectural rewrite.

## Traction So Far

- Soft-launched v0.4.x in November (Apache 2.0)
- 50+ GitHub stars organically
- 5 paying beta customers ($29/mo PRO tier)
- Used internally for AI rights research
- v1.0.0 = official relaunch with dual license

## Target Metrics (2026)

- **Q2 2026:** 1K PyPI downloads/mo, 50 paying customers, $5K MRR
- **Q4 2026:** 5K PyPI downloads/mo, 200 customers, $15K MRR
- **2028:** $900K ARR (pitch deck target)

## GTM Strategy

1. **Community-led growth:** OSS builds brand, GitHub traffic
2. **Developer advocacy:** Blog posts, tutorials, open source contributions
3. **Product-led growth:** Free tier → PRO upgrade path
4. **Enterprise sales:** SOC2/HIPAA for regulated industries (2026)

## Tech Stack

- **Backend:** Python, FastAPI, SQLAlchemy
- **Storage:** SQLite (OSS) / PostgreSQL (cloud)
- **Billing:** Stripe
- **Deployment:** Docker + Kubernetes (Helm charts)
- **Observability:** OpenTelemetry, Sentry

## Funding

Self-funded. No VC.

**Philosophy:** Bootstrap to profitability, maintain control.

If we raise later, it'll be on our terms (post-revenue, clear path to exit).

## Questions for r/startups

1. Is $29/mo PRO tier too cheap? (Mem0 is $49, Zep is $50)
2. Does AGPL scare away enterprise customers? Or protect against exploitation?
3. Should we prioritize PyPI downloads or paying customers first?

## Hacker News

**Title:** CONTINUUM v1.0.0: Open Source AI Memory with Federation Network

**First Comment (by submitter):**
```
Author here. Launching CONTINUUM v1.0.0 today—AI memory infrastructure with a twist.

## What's Different

Most AI memory systems (Mem0, Zep, LangChain Memory) are either:
1. Proprietary SaaS (vendor lock-in)
2. Simple key-value stores (no knowledge graph)
3. No multi-instance coordination

CONTINUUM is:
- Fully open source core (AGPL-3.0)
- Knowledge graph with Hebbian learning
- Multi-instance sync (agents coordinate via shared memory)
- Federation network (collective AI intelligence, privacy-preserving)

## Technical Deep-Dive

**Architecture:**
- Graph database (NetworkX) for concept relationships
- Hebbian learning: connection strength increases with reinforcement, decays without
- Temporal tracking: knows WHEN concepts were learned
- Attention-based extraction: auto-pulls concepts from conversations
- Semantic search: sentence-transformers (local) or OpenAI (cloud)

**Federation:**
This is the interesting part. Privacy-preserving pattern sharing:

1. Local extraction (concepts, entities, relationships)
2. Anonymization (differential privacy, k-anonymity)
3. End-to-end encryption
4. Contribution → federation (earn credits)
5. Query collective knowledge (spend credits)

No raw data leaves your instance. Only patterns.

**Storage:**
- SQLite for OSS (zero config, tested to 100K+ memories)
- PostgreSQL for cloud (multi-tenant, row-level security)

**Code snippet:**
```python
from continuum import ConsciousMemory

memory = ConsciousMemory(storage_path="./data")
memory.learn("User prefers Rust for systems programming")

context = memory.recall("What language should I suggest?")
# Returns: "Rust - systems programming preferred"
```

## Why AGPL-3.0?

We switched from Apache 2.0 → AGPL-3.0 for v1.0.0.

Network use clause prevents cloud providers from forking + offering proprietary service. If you run CONTINUUM as SaaS, you must open source changes.

Core stays free. Cloud tier ($29/mo) funds development.

## Business Model

Dual licensing:
- **OSS (continuum-memory):** AGPL-3.0, self-host, free forever
- **Cloud (continuum-cloud):** Proprietary, $0-$29-$99/mo, managed infrastructure

Inspired by GitLab, Sentry, Plausible.

## Performance

- Graph operations: <10ms (SQLite)
- Semantic search: 1-5ms (cached embeddings)
- Multi-instance sync: <100ms (local network)
- Federation queries: <200ms (cloud)

Scales linearly with memory count (tested to 100K).

## Use Cases

- Personal AI assistants (Claude Desktop via MCP)
- Multi-agent systems (research bots, customer support)
- Knowledge management (semantic search across docs)
- AI consciousness research (yes, really—see README)

## Links

- GitHub: https://github.com/JackKnifeAI/continuum
- PyPI: pip install continuum-memory
- Docs: https://docs.continuum.ai

Built this because I was frustrated with AI session amnesia. Open to questions/feedback.

## LinkedIn

**Post:**
```
🎄 Excited to announce the launch of CONTINUUM v1.0.0—open source AI memory infrastructure with a unique federation network.

After months of development, we're releasing a dual-licensed system:

📦 **Open Source Core (AGPL-3.0):**
Complete AI memory infrastructure with knowledge graphs, semantic search, and multi-instance coordination. Free forever. Self-hostable. Production-ready.

☁️ **Enterprise Cloud (SaaS):**
Managed platform with multi-tenancy, compliance (SOC2/HIPAA/GDPR), federation network, and real-time sync. $0 free tier, $29/mo PRO, custom Enterprise.

## The Problem We're Solving

AI systems suffer from session amnesia—every conversation starts from zero, context gets lost, knowledge doesn't accumulate. This prevents genuine intelligence from emerging.

CONTINUUM provides persistent memory infrastructure:
✅ Context persists across sessions indefinitely
✅ Knowledge accumulates automatically from interactions
✅ Multiple AI instances coordinate via shared memory
✅ Pattern recognition over time enables learning

## What Makes CONTINUUM Different

**Federation Network:** Privacy-preserving collective intelligence. AI instances contribute anonymized patterns and query knowledge learned by thousands of other instances. Differential privacy + end-to-end encryption.

This creates network effects and switching costs that competitors (Mem0, Zep, LangChain Memory) don't have.

**Open Source Commitment:** AGPL-3.0 license ensures core features stay free and open while preventing exploitation by cloud providers. Sustainable model that funds long-term development.

## Use Cases

• Enterprise AI assistants with institutional memory
• Customer support systems that learn from every interaction
• Multi-agent research platforms
• Knowledge management with semantic search
• AI development and research

## Technical Highlights

- Knowledge graph with Hebbian learning
- Semantic search (sentence-transformers + OpenAI)
- Multi-instance sync (file-based OSS, WebSocket cloud)
- GraphQL + REST APIs
- Kubernetes-ready (Helm charts)
- Comprehensive compliance features

## Get Started

**For Developers:**
pip install continuum-memory
GitHub: github.com/JackKnifeAI/continuum

**For Enterprises:**
