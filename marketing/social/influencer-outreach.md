Hi Andrej,

Longtime follower. Your work on making neural nets understandable has been hugely influential.

Built something I think you might find interesting: CONTINUUM - persistent memory infrastructure for AI systems.

Technical contribution: Knowledge graph architecture with O(log n) query, auto-extraction from conversation, and multi-instance coordination. Treating memory as first-class infrastructure, not afterthought.

Handles 1M+ concepts, semantic search with embeddings, real-time sync across instances.

Not asking for promotion - but if it's genuinely interesting to you, feedback from someone with your perspective would be valuable.

- Production-ready (ACID, scale, reliability)

Already built basic integration:
```python
from langchain.memory import ContinuumMemory

memory = ContinuumMemory(auto_extract=True)
chain = ConversationChain(llm=llm, memory=memory)
```

Open to collaboration on official integration if interesting.
