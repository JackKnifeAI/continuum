## Core Messages (Consistency Across Platforms)

### Problem Statement
"Current AI systems suffer from session amnesia. Every conversation starts from zero. Context vanishes. Knowledge doesn't accumulate. Multiple AI instances can't coordinate."

### Solution Statement
"CONTINUUM provides persistent memory infrastructure with knowledge graph architecture, auto-learning from conversation, and multi-instance coordination."

### Key Differentiators
1. **Knowledge Graph**: Structured relationships, not just key-value storage
2. **Auto-Learning**: No manual annotation required
3. **Multi-Instance**: Native coordination across AI agents
4. **Privacy-First**: Local by default, no cloud required
5. **Production-Ready**: ACID guarantees, handles 1M+ concepts
6. **Open Source**: Apache 2.0, fully transparent

### Use Cases (Pick 2-3 per post)
- Personal AI assistants that genuinely remember you
- Multi-agent systems with shared intelligence
- Customer support with real continuity
- Research tools that build knowledge over time
- Autonomous agents with persistent memory

### Call to Action
- Primary: `pip install continuum-memory`
- Secondary: Star on GitHub
- Tertiary: Read docs, contribute

## Risk Mitigation

### Common Pitfalls

**"Show HN without substance"**:
- ✅ Mitigation: Working code, comprehensive docs, real examples
- ✅ Evidence: v0.2.0 released, production deployments

**"Overhyped marketing"**:
- ✅ Mitigation: Technical focus, honest limitations, no buzzwords
- ✅ Tone: "Built for myself, sharing in case useful"

**"Unclear differentiation"**:
- ✅ Mitigation: Clear comparison to alternatives in every post
- ✅ Specific: Why not RAG/vectors/Neo4j explained

**"Privacy concerns"**:
- ✅ Mitigation: Local-first emphasis, no cloud, Apache 2.0
- ✅ Transparency: Code is auditable

**"Negative feedback spiral"**:
- ✅ Mitigation: Gracious responses, learn from criticism
- ✅ Don't: Get defensive, argue, dismiss concerns

### Response Templates for Common Concerns

**"Why not just use X?"**
```
Great question! [X] is excellent for [their strength].

CONTINUUM differs in:
1. [Specific technical difference]
2. [Use case difference]
3. [Architecture difference]

They can actually be complementary: [example of using both]

What's your use case? Might help determine best fit.
```

**"Security/privacy concerns?"**
```
Valid concern. Here's how we handle it:

✅ Local-first by default (SQLite, your machine)
✅ No telemetry, no cloud calls
✅ Optional encryption at rest
✅ Apache 2.0 (code is auditable)

For federated mode (optional):
- You choose what to share
- Cryptographic verification
- Privacy-preserving aggregation

Specific concerns I can address?
```

**"Performance at scale?"**
```
Good question. Tested at 1M concepts:

Performance:
- Simple lookup: ~1ms
- Semantic search: ~50ms
- Graph traversal (3-hop): ~10ms

Scalability:
- SQLite: ~1M concepts (practical limit)
- PostgreSQL: Billions (production scale)

Your use case scale?
```
