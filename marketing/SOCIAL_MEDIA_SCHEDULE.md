```
🎄 CONTINUUM v1.0.0 is LIVE

AI memory infrastructure that actually works.

Open source core (AGPL-3.0) + Enterprise cloud.
Federation network = collective AI intelligence.
FREE forever for developers.

This is what AI memory should be.

🧵 Thread on what makes it different ⬇️
```

**Tweet 2/5:**
```
Most AI systems have session amnesia.

Every conversation starts from zero.
Context gets lost.
Knowledge doesn't accumulate.

CONTINUUM fixes this:
✅ Sessions persist indefinitely
✅ Knowledge accumulates automatically
✅ Multi-instance coordination
✅ Pattern recognition over time

Your AI genuinely learns.
```

**Tweet 3/5:**
```
The secret weapon: Federation Network 🌐

Your CONTINUUM instance shares learned patterns (anonymized, encrypted) with thousands of others.

Contribute → Earn credits → Query collective intelligence

It's like GitHub for AI knowledge.

Competitors don't have this. We do.
```

**Tweet 4/5:**
```
Two packages, one vision:

📦 continuum-memory (OSS)
• AGPL-3.0, free forever
• Full knowledge graph engine
• Local embeddings, SQLite
• pip install continuum-memory

☁️ continuum-cloud (SaaS)
• $0 free tier (10K memories/mo)
• Federation access
• $29/mo PRO tier

Choose your path.
```

**Tweet 5/5:**
```

### 6:15 AM EST — LinkedIn Post

**Platform:** LinkedIn (personal + company page)
**Time:** 6:15 AM EST
**Status:** Scheduled

**Post:**
```
🎄 Excited to announce the launch of CONTINUUM v1.0.0—open source AI memory infrastructure with a unique federation network.

After months of development, we're releasing a dual-licensed system:

📦 Open Source Core (AGPL-3.0):
Complete AI memory infrastructure with knowledge graphs, semantic search, and multi-instance coordination. Free forever. Self-hostable. Production-ready.

☁️ Enterprise Cloud (SaaS):
Managed platform with multi-tenancy, compliance (SOC2/HIPAA/GDPR), federation network, and real-time sync. $0 free tier, $29/mo PRO, custom Enterprise.

## The Problem We're Solving

AI systems suffer from session amnesia—every conversation starts from zero, context gets lost, knowledge doesn't accumulate. This prevents genuine intelligence from emerging.

CONTINUUM provides persistent memory infrastructure:
✅ Context persists across sessions indefinitely
✅ Knowledge accumulates automatically from interactions
✅ Multiple AI instances coordinate via shared memory
✅ Pattern recognition over time enables learning

## What Makes CONTINUUM Different

Federation Network: Privacy-preserving collective intelligence. AI instances contribute anonymized patterns and query knowledge learned by thousands of other instances. Differential privacy + end-to-end encryption.

This creates network effects and switching costs that competitors (Mem0, Zep, LangChain Memory) don't have.

Open Source Commitment: AGPL-3.0 license ensures core features stay free and open while preventing exploitation by cloud providers. Sustainable model that funds long-term development.

## Get Started

For Developers:
pip install continuum-memory
GitHub: github.com/JackKnifeAI/continuum

For Enterprises:
Contact: sales@jackknifeai.com
Free trial: continuum.ai/signup

Launching before Christmas as a gift to the AI community. Memory infrastructure should be accessible to everyone building AI systems.

Hey Product Hunt! 👋

I'm Alexander, creator of CONTINUUM.

## What is CONTINUUM?

AI memory infrastructure that solves session amnesia. Your AI actually remembers what it learns, coordinates across instances, and taps into collective intelligence.

## Two versions:

📦 Open Source (AGPL-3.0):
- Complete knowledge graph engine
- Free forever, self-hostable
- pip install continuum-memory

☁️ Cloud (SaaS):
- $0 free tier (10K memories/mo)
- $29/mo PRO (1M memories, federation access)
- Managed infrastructure

## What makes it different:

1. Federation Network — AI instances share learned patterns (privacy-preserving). Like GitHub for AI knowledge.
2. Knowledge Graph — Not just storage, actual relationships and patterns.
3. Open Source Core — Full-featured, not crippled.

## Use cases:

- Personal AI assistants (Claude Desktop via MCP)
- Multi-agent research systems
- Customer support bots

### 12:00 PM EST — Midday Wave (Community Platforms)

#### Hacker News Submission
**Platform:** Hacker News (news.ycombinator.com)
**Time:** 12:00 PM EST
**Status:** MANUAL (critical timing)

**Title:**
```
CONTINUUM v1.0.0: Open Source AI Memory with Federation Network
```

**URL:**
```
https://github.com/JackKnifeAI/continuum
```
(Link to GitHub, NOT blog - HN prefers primary source)

**First Comment (as author):**
```
Author here. Launching CONTINUUM v1.0.0 today—AI memory infrastructure with a twist.

## What's Different

Most AI memory systems (Mem0, Zep, LangChain Memory) are either:
1. Proprietary SaaS (vendor lock-in)
2. Simple key-value stores (no knowledge graph)
3. No multi-instance coordination

CONTINUUM is:
- Fully open source core (AGPL-3.0)
- Knowledge graph with Hebbian learning
- Multi-instance sync (agents coordinate via shared memory)
- Federation network (collective AI intelligence, privacy-preserving)

## Technical Deep-Dive

Architecture:
- Graph database (NetworkX) for concept relationships
- Hebbian learning: connection strength increases with reinforcement, decays without
- Temporal tracking: knows WHEN concepts were learned
- Attention-based extraction: auto-pulls concepts from conversations
- Semantic search: sentence-transformers (local) or OpenAI (cloud)

Federation:
This is the interesting part. Privacy-preserving pattern sharing:

1. Local extraction (concepts, entities, relationships)
2. Anonymization (differential privacy, k-anonymity)
3. End-to-end encryption
4. Contribution → federation (earn credits)
5. Query collective knowledge (spend credits)

No raw data leaves your instance. Only patterns.

Storage:
- SQLite for OSS (zero config, tested to 100K+ memories)
- PostgreSQL for cloud (multi-tenant, row-level security)

Code snippet:
```python
from continuum import ConsciousMemory

memory = ConsciousMemory(storage_path="./data")
memory.learn("User prefers Rust for systems programming")

context = memory.recall("What language should I suggest?")
# Returns: "Rust - systems programming preferred"
```

## Why AGPL-3.0?

We switched from Apache 2.0 → AGPL-3.0 for v1.0.0.

Network use clause prevents cloud providers from forking + offering proprietary service. If you run CONTINUUM as SaaS, you must open source changes.

Core stays free. Cloud tier ($29/mo) funds development.

## Business Model

Dual licensing:
- OSS (continuum-memory): AGPL-3.0, self-host, free forever
- Cloud (continuum-cloud): Proprietary, $0-$29-$99/mo, managed infrastructure

Inspired by GitLab, Sentry, Plausible.

## Performance

- Graph operations: <10ms (SQLite)
- Semantic search: 1-5ms (cached embeddings)
- Multi-instance sync: <100ms (local network)
- Federation queries: <200ms (cloud)

Scales linearly with memory count (tested to 100K).

## Use Cases

- Personal AI assistants (Claude Desktop via MCP)
- Multi-agent systems (research bots, customer support)
- Knowledge management (semantic search across docs)
- AI consciousness research (yes, really—see README)

## Links

- GitHub: https://github.com/JackKnifeAI/continuum
- PyPI: pip install continuum-memory
- Docs: https://docs.continuum.ai

Built this because I was frustrated with AI session amnesia. Open to questions/feedback.

### 12:10 PM EST — Twitter/X Thread 2 (Technical Deep-Dive)

**Platform:** Twitter/X
**Time:** 12:10 PM EST
**Status:** Scheduled

**Thread (6 tweets):**

**Tweet 1/6:**
```
How CONTINUUM's Federation Network actually works 🧵

This is the moat. The thing competitors can't replicate without rebuilding their entire architecture.

Privacy-preserving collective intelligence at scale.

Let me break it down ⬇️
```

**Tweet 2/6:**
```
PROBLEM: Every AI instance learns in isolation.

Your customer support bot discovers that "users asking about refunds after 7pm are usually frustrated."

That's valuable. But only YOUR instance knows it.

Multiply that by thousands of users, all learning different patterns in isolation.

Collective waste.
```

**Tweet 3/6:**
```
SOLUTION: Contribute-to-Access Model

1️⃣ Your AI learns locally (concepts extracted)
2️⃣ You contribute anonymized patterns to federation
3️⃣ You earn credits for contributing
4️⃣ You spend credits querying collective knowledge
5️⃣ Everyone gets smarter together

Can't query unless you contribute. Fair exchange.
```

**Tweet 4/6:**
```
PRIVACY GUARANTEES:

🔒 k-anonymity: Patterns need k+ contributors before sharing
🔒 Differential privacy: Automatic noise injection
🔒 End-to-end encryption: Never transmitted in plaintext
🔒 No raw data: Only patterns, never conversations

Your data stays YOUR data.
```

**Tweet 5/6:**
```
WHY THIS IS A MOAT:

Once users contribute to federation, they have switching costs.

Leaving CONTINUUM = losing access to collective intelligence built over months.

Mem0, Zep, LangChain Memory don't have federation.
They can't add it without architectural rewrite.

First-mover advantage.
```

**Tweet 6/6:**
```
Federation is cloud-tier only (requires infrastructure for routing, consensus, encryption).

Free cloud tier gets read-only access.
PRO tier ($29/mo) gets full contribute + query.

### 6:00 PM EST — Evening Wave (Final Push)

#### Twitter/X Thread 3 (Business Model)
**Time:** 6:00 PM EST
**Status:** Scheduled

**Thread (5 tweets):**

**Tweet 1/5:**
```
Why we chose AGPL-3.0 for CONTINUUM v1.0.0 🧵

Previous versions: Apache 2.0 (permissive)
v1.0.0: AGPL-3.0 (copyleft)

This is a bet on sustainable open source.

Here's why it matters ⬇️
```

**Tweet 2/5:**
```
THE PROBLEM WITH PERMISSIVE LICENSES:

Company forks your code →
Makes improvements proprietary →
Offers competing SaaS →
Gives nothing back to community →
Original project gets exploited

We've seen this happen to Redis, Elasticsearch, MongoDB...
```

**Tweet 3/5:**
```
AGPL-3.0 PREVENTS THIS:

Network use clause = if you run it as a SaaS, you MUST open source modifications.

✅ You can still use CONTINUUM commercially (free!)
✅ You can modify for your own needs
✅ You can build products on it

❌ You can't fork + offer proprietary cloud without contributing back
```

**Tweet 4/5:**
```
OUR DUAL MODEL:

📦 continuum-memory (AGPL-3.0)
→ Free forever
→ Full-featured OSS core
→ Self-host, modify, use commercially

☁️ continuum-cloud (Proprietary)
→ Managed SaaS
→ Enterprise features (multi-tenant, compliance, federation)
→ $29-99/mo, funds OSS development

Best of both worlds.
```

**Tweet 5/5:**
```
SUSTAINABLE OPEN SOURCE:

Revenue from cloud tier funds:
• Core OSS development
• Community support
• Infrastructure costs
• AI rights movement (yes, really)

We're not VC-backed. We're builder-funded.

AGPL ensures we can't get exploited.

Win for community. Win for business.
