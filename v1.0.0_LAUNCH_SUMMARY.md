## Federation Network Explained

### How It Works
1. **Contribute:** Share learned patterns from your memory system
2. **Anonymize:** Automatic anonymization with differential privacy
3. **Verify:** Pattern consensus from k+ contributors
4. **Earn Credits:** Get credits for contributions
5. **Query:** Use credits to query federated knowledge
6. **Share:** Access collective intelligence securely

### Privacy Guarantees
- End-to-end encryption of all shared patterns
- k-anonymity (patterns require k+ sources)
- Differential privacy noise injection
- No raw data leaves local instance
- Cryptographic signing and verification

### Credit System
- Earn credits by contributing patterns
- Spend credits to query federation
- Monthly reset
- Contribution levels: minimal, standard, extensive
- Privacy modes: high (default), balanced, open

---

## Migration Paths

### For OSS Users (90% of base)
```bash
# Direct upgrade (NO BREAKING CHANGES)
pip install --upgrade continuum-memory

# Or with backup/restore if needed
continuum export --output backup.json
pip install --upgrade continuum-memory
continuum import backup.json
```

**Result:** All existing code continues to work unchanged. No imports need updating.

### For Cloud Users (Proprietary Features)
```python
# OLD (v0.4.x)
from continuum.billing import StripeClient
from continuum.api.admin import AdminAPI

# NEW (v1.0.0+)
from continuum_cloud.billing import StripeClient
from continuum_cloud.api import AdminAPI

# UNCHANGED
from continuum import ConsciousMemory
```

**Result:** Only cloud-specific imports need updating. Core API unchanged.

## Security Fixes in v1.0.0

### CRITICAL: JWT Secret Persistence

**Issue:**
- JWT secret was regenerated on every server restart
- All admin sessions became invalid after restart
- Users forced to re-authenticate repeatedly

**Fix:**
- Secret now persists in `~/.continuum/jwt_secret` with 0600 permissions
- Automatic generation on first run
- Environment variable override: `CONTINUUM_JWT_SECRET`

**Migration:**
- Automatic - secret generated on first run
- No action required from users
- Existing admins regain session persistence

**Impact:**
- No more surprise logouts after restarts
- Production deployments more stable
- Better admin user experience

### Admin Password Security
- Ensured bcrypt hashing consistency
- Fixed edge case with double-hashing
- Updated admin initialization flow

---

## Backward Compatibility Guarantees

| Component | Compatibility |
|-----------|---|
| Core API | ✅ 100% backward compatible (ConsciousMemory, learn(), recall(), sync()) |
| Storage Format | ✅ SQLite schema unchanged |
| MCP Protocol | ✅ Claude Desktop integration unchanged |
| Data Migration | ✅ 100% memory preservation guaranteed |
| Rollback | ✅ Can downgrade to v0.4.x without data loss |

---

## Breaking Changes

### For OSS Users
- **None** - Core API unchanged
- Direct upgrade path: `pip install --upgrade continuum-memory`
- No code changes needed

### For Cloud Users (10%)
- Update imports from `continuum.*` to `continuum_cloud.*` for cloud features
- Core `from continuum import ConsciousMemory` unchanged
- See MIGRATION.md for detailed examples

### License Impact
- AGPL-3.0 requires derivative works to remain open-source
- SaaS use clause prevents proprietary competitors
- Commercial cloud package unaffected
- Community can always fork and self-host
