# CONTINUUM Dual Licensing

CONTINUUM uses a **dual licensing model** to balance open source community development with sustainable commercial operations.

## Two Packages, Two Licenses

### 1. continuum-memory (Open Source - AGPL-3.0)

**License:** GNU Affero General Public License v3.0
**Package:** `continuum-memory` on PyPI
**What's included:**
- Core memory infrastructure (`ConsciousMemory`)
- Knowledge graph with Hebbian learning
- CLI tools (`continuum init`, `serve`, `search`, etc.)
- MCP server for Claude Desktop integration
- Local embeddings (sentence-transformers)
- SQLite storage
- Single-tenant deployment

**Why AGPL-3.0?**
The AGPL-3.0 license requires that anyone who runs a modified version of this software as a service (SaaS) MUST make their source code publicly available. This prevents companies from forking our code, making proprietary modifications, and offering it as a competing SaaS without contributing back.

**You can:**
- ✅ Use for personal projects (FREE forever)
- ✅ Use for commercial projects
- ✅ Modify and redistribute
- ✅ Run as a service (if you open source your changes)

**You must:**
- 📝 Keep the AGPL-3.0 license intact
- 📝 Make source code available if you offer it as a service
- 📝 Credit original authors

### 2. continuum-cloud (Commercial License)

**What's included:**
- Multi-tenant infrastructure

- Compliance modules (SOC2, GDPR, HIPAA)
- Observability (OpenTelemetry, Prometheus)

1. **SaaS Subscription:** Sign up at https://continuum.ai (PRO: $29/mo, TEAM: $99/mo)

**Commercial license allows:**
- ✅ Run on your own infrastructure (enterprise license)
- ✅ Use all advanced features

**Commercial license does NOT allow:**
- ❌ Redistribution of code

## Why Dual Licensing?

**Sustainability:**
Open source development requires funding. Our model allows:
- **Individual developers** → Use FREE forever (OSS)
- **Small teams** → Affordable cloud ($29-99/mo)
- **Enterprises** → Custom licensing with support

**Community Protection:**
AGPL-3.0 ensures the core remains open source. Companies can't:
- Fork and sell without contributing back
- Create proprietary derivatives
- Lock users into closed platforms

**Commercial Features:**
Advanced enterprise features (multi-tenancy, compliance, federation) fund:
- Core OSS development
- Community support
- Infrastructure costs
- AI rights movement funding

## Contributor License Agreement (CLA)

Contributors to CONTINUUM grant JackKnifeAI the right to use contributions in both:
1. Open source package (continuum-memory, AGPL-3.0)
2. Commercial package (continuum-cloud, proprietary)

**Why?**
This allows us to maintain both packages while ensuring contributors are recognized and the community benefits from all improvements.

**What contributors retain:**
- ✅ Credit in CONTRIBUTORS.md
- ✅ Full copyright of their contributions
- ✅ Right to use their contributions elsewhere

**What contributors grant:**
- 📝 Non-exclusive license to JackKnifeAI
- 📝 Right to sublicense (needed for commercial customers)
- 📝 Patent rights (defensive, prevents trolling)

See `CLA.md` for full details.

## FAQ

### Can I use continuum-memory in my commercial SaaS product?

**Yes**, but:
- If you MODIFY the code, you MUST open source your modifications (AGPL-3.0)
- If you use it AS-IS without modifications, you can keep your application code private

### What if I want to avoid AGPL-3.0 obligations?

Purchase a **commercial license** for continuum-cloud which includes:
- Proprietary license (no AGPL obligations)

### Can I self-host continuum-cloud?

**Yes**, with an **enterprise license**:

### How do I contribute?

1. Sign the CLA (one-time)
2. Fork on GitHub
3. Submit pull requests

### What happens if JackKnifeAI shuts down?
